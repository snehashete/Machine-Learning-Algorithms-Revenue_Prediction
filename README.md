Random Forest: A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees created using random variable selection and bootstrap aggregating. At each node of the tree, the split is created according to the random subset of the variables. We applied this algorithm on the training data set, setting the ntree parameter to 1000 with respect to revenue.
