RANDOM FOREST: A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees created using random variable selection and bootstrap aggregating. At each node of the tree, the split is created according to the random subset of the variables. We applied this algorithm on the training data set, setting the ntree parameter to 1000 with respect to revenue.

LOGISTIC REGRESSION: Logistic Regression is a predictive analysis used to describe the data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one/more nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio-level independent variables. In our data set we used this algorithm to predict revenues with respect to the effective parameters: City.Group, Open.Date, Type, P8, P26, P28, Open.Year.
